Welcome to the USB Doodad.

The USB Doodad is a project to give people the opportunity to try out
surface mount soldering, and end up with a fun programmable USB device.
The design is available under an open license for anyone to copy and
enjoy.

This release is version 39, although by the time you read this, there
may well be a later version.

The design is licenced under a Creative Commons licence.  That means
you can take the plans, buy the parts yourself, and build it.  Or for
the easy way, you can buy it from us as a kit, with the chip pre-soldered.

Project Status

We have had working prototypes for several months.  They have proven to
be very reliable, and have worked in every PC we've tried them in.

We currently have parts to build 50 boards, and we are working towards
making these kits available.
