These design files are for the schematic and board layout of the USB Doodad.
The program used is KiCad, an open source package available for Windows,
Linux and Mac.  I really like using KiCad, partly because it's free, partly
because it seems far less crufty and more "willing" than Eagle, and partly
because of the text-based file format, which has been very useful on several
occasions because I can hand-edit the data to fix up something that would
otherwise have taken a long time in the GUI.  You can get KiCad here:

If you're new to KiCad, you may be wondering what all these files are:

  doodad.pro

    The project file.  It has some project-wide settings, such as which
    libraries to use.

  doodad.lib

    Customised schematic symbols used in the USB Doodad.

  doodad.sch

    The schematic.

  doodad.net

    The list of connections between components.

  doodad.cmp

    The list of components for the board, and for each component, the name of
    the footprint to use.

  doodad.brd

    The layout for the circuit board.

  doodad.mod

    Customised footprints for the surface mount parts used in the USB Doodad.

  doodad.mdc

    Info about customised footprints, such as description and keywords.

In addition, there's a layoutless board just to make it easier to see the
components used, to help select the component for footprint editing:

  doodad-footprints.pro

    The project file.

  doodad-footprints.brd

    The board file for the footprints used in the USB Doodad.

And some extra stuff:

  extra/

    cvt.py

      A small python script to convert millimeters to 1/10000 of an inch.
      Useful for hand-editing footprint files when you're adding a component
      where the size is specified in millimetres.

    usb-coordinates.ods

      An undocumented OpenOffice spreadsheet used for calculating the
      coordinates for the USB contact fingers.
